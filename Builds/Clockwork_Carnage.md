# Clockwork Carnage
**Clockwork Carnage** is a full Fighter build that focuses on a large number of attacks and massive damage for each successful hit.

---
## Level Breakdown 🎲
This build focuses on [Fighter](https://www.dndbeyond.com) leveling, so there is no multiclassing breakdown, only a single class.

---
## Race 👽
The race is [Variant Human](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/human) in order to acquire one of the most important parts of this build: the [Crossbow Expert feat](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:crossbow-expert).

---
## Ability Scores 📊
To provide a high attack roll modifier and make use of subclass features, we will focus on maximizing our *Dexterity* and *Intelligence* modifiers. Additionally, we will make *Constitution* our third-highest score to gain more HP.

The table below shows the Ability Scores for our build (Race modifiers included).

| Ability | Score | Race Additions | Final | Modifier |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| Strength | 8 | None | **8** | -1 |
| Dexterity | 15 | +1 | **16** | +3 |
| Constitution | 14 | None | **14** | +2 |
| Intelligence | 15 | +1 | **16** | +3 |
| Wisdom | 10 | None | **10** | +0 |
| Charisma | 8 | None | **8** | -1 |

## Equipment 💣
Make sure to use a [Hand Crossbow](https://www.dndbeyond.com). This weapon gives us an additional attack as a bonus action and allows the [Crossbow Expert feat](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:crossbow-expert) to function.

You can take any equipment for defense, but I recommend the following:

- **Shield**: For +2 to AC
- **Scale Mail**: For optimal AC at a low cost

## Leveling Up ⬆️
This build becomes stronger over time by increasing modifiers, proficiency bonuses, and the number of attacks.

At **3rd level**, choose the [Psi Warrior subclass](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter:psi-warrior). It provides a damage bonus and the ability to knock enemies back, along with support abilities for roleplay or utility in combat.

Alternatively, you can choose the [Battle Master](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter:battle-master) subclass to make your attacks more powerful with additional effects (maneuvers).

The core of this build is **4th level**. At this level, the [Sharpshooter feat](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:sharpshooter) is a must-have. This provides powerful attacks that deal massive damage if they hit.

At **5th level**, we gain an Extra Attack, and the build is fully online. From there, you can progress as you wish, but stay within the [Fighter class](https://www.dndbeyond.com).

---

## Combat Mechanics & Synergy ⚡
On your turn at 5th level, use your regular action to attack with your crossbow. Extra Attack lets you do this twice. Then, as a bonus action (via Crossbow Expert), shoot a third time.

Make sure to use the [Sharpshooter feat](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:sharpshooter) for each attack to maximize damage.

If every shot hits, the damage for one turn will be:
**3d6 + 9 (DEX) + 30 (Sharpshooter)** *piercing damage*.

---

## Conclusion ✅
With this build, you will be a great support and a powerful damage dealer. 

I wish you a cool game and great character development!
