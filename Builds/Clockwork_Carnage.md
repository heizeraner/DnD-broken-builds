## Level Breakdown 🎲
This build focuses on [*Fighter*](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/2190879-fighter?srsltid=AfmBOoq7pb8BVT7VvAPk-_0apM1umfXLxJoomKx-oTrdgFvN4au6IZ7b) leveling, so there is no breakdown but a single class.

## Race 👽
Race is [*Variant Human*](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/human) in order to acquire one of the most important parts of this idea: [*Crossbow Expert feat*](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:crossbow-expert).

## Ability scores 📊
In order to provide us with good attack roll modificator and use of subclass featres we will focus on maximizing our *Dexterity* and *Intelligence* modifiers. Also, we will make *Constitution* our third best modifier to get a bit more HP.

Table below shows Ability scores for our build.

(Race modifiers added)

| Ability | Score | Race Additions |Final | Modifier
| - | - | - | - | - |
| Strength | 8 | None | **8** | -1 |

## Equipment 💣
Make sure to use [*Crossbow(Hand)*](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/1-crossbow-hand?srsltid=AfmBOoqPbsvSln9evp5AAvvwCPd7cJ2Z_2LrK6hEBTGyJDLfS7mdXomF). This weapon gives us additional attack as a bonus action and lets [*Crossbow Expert feat*](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:crossbow-expert) work.

Then, you take any equipment for your defense but I reccomend following:

- **Shield** - for 2 to AC
- **Scale mail** - for optimal AC at low costs

## Leveling up ⬆️
This build becomes stronger with time, mainly by getting better modifiers, proficiency bonus and more attacks.

On *3rd level* grab the [*Psi Warrior subclass*](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter:psi-warrior). It provides us with not only a damage bonus and the ability to knock enemies in the future but with some support abilities which can help in roleplay or different situations in combat.

Also, the core part of this build is *4th level*. On this level the [*Sharpshooter feat*](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:sharpshooter) is must-have. This one provides us with powerful attacks which deal *massive* damage if they hit.

On *5th level* we get an extra attack and then we are all set.

On your way you can then do whatever you want, but stick to the [*Fighter class*](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/2190879-fighter?srsltid=AfmBOoq7pb8BVT7VvAPk-_0apM1umfXLxJoomKx-oTrdgFvN4au6IZ7b).

## Combat Mechanics & Synergy ⚡
On your turn, on 5th level, as regular action, attack with your crossbow. Extra attack lets you do it twice. Then, as bonus action, shoot third time.

Make suer to use [*Sharpshooter feat*](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:sharpshooter) for each attack to maximize the damage.

If everything hits, the damage for one turn will be:

**3d6 + 9(DEX) + 30(Sharpshooter)** *piercing damage*.

---

## Conclusion ✅
With this build you will be a great support and powerful damage dealer.

With these words I wish to have a cool game and great character development skills.

### Bye!
