# Frame Breaker
**Frame Breaker** is a full Monk build that focuses on "Hit & Run" tactics while dealing solid amounts of damage. This build provides a variety of active ki-dependent abilities to ensure gameplay is highly versatile.

---
## Level Breakdown 🎲
This build focuses on [Monk](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/monk) leveling, so there is no multiclassing breakdown, only a single class.

---
## Race 👽
The race is [Wood Elf](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/lineage:elf) in order to acquire longsword proficiency and increased movement speed. Because of this proficiency, you will have the ability to use a longsword as a dedicated weapon.

---
## Ability Scores 📊
To provide a high attack roll modifier and make use of subclass features, we will focus on maximizing our *Dexterity* and *Wisdom* modifiers. Additionally, we will make *Constitution* our third-highest score to gain more HP.

The table below shows the Ability Scores for our build (Race modifiers included).

| Ability | Score | Race Additions | Final | Modifier |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| Strength | 8 | None | **8** | -1 |
| Dexterity | 15 | +2 | **17** | +3 |
| Constitution | 15 | None | **15** | +2 |
| Intelligence | 8 | None | **8** | -1 |
| Wisdom | 15 | +1 | **16** | +3 |
| Charisma | 8 | None | **8** | -1 |

## Equipment 💣
Make sure to use a **Longsword**. This weapon gives us good damage and can be used as a dedicated weapon.

That is the core of what you need, so you can even save some money afterward.

## Leveling Up ⬆️
This build becomes stronger over time by increasing modifiers and proficiency bonuses while granting more active abilities.

At **3rd level**, choose the [Way of Mercy subclass](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/monk:mercy). It is considered one of the best Monk subclasses and provides the user with the ability to heal and deal extra damage.

The core of this build is **4th level**. At this level, grab the [Mobile feat](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:mobile) to avoid enemy attacks and move freely.

At **5th level**, we gain an Extra Attack, which is a great addition to our build.

Lastly, the further you progress, the faster you become. For example, at **6th level**, your movement speed is:

**`35 (Wood Elf) + 15 (Class) + 10 (Feat) = 60 ft.`**

This is double the movement speed of regular humanoids. When you duel a creature, there is almost no way it can catch and attack you in the same turn. 

---

## Combat Mechanics & Synergy ⚡
On your turn at 5th level, use your regular action to attack with your longsword. Extra Attack lets you do this twice. Then, as a bonus action, you can attack with an unarmed strike.

Thanks to the **Mobile** feat, you can then run as far as possible without triggering opportunity attacks from the enemies you attacked.

If every hit lands, the damage for one turn will be:

**`2d10 + 1d6 + 9 (DEX)`** *damage*.

While this amount may not seem massive, you can also use active abilities (like Hand of Harm) to deal more damage or heal an ally.

---

## Conclusion ✅
With this build, you will be able to attack an enemy and instantly fade away, "breaking" the number of visible frames. 

I wish you an insane amount of speed and great character development!
