# Frame Breaker
**Frame Breaker** is a full Monk build that focuses on "Hit & Run" tactic, while dealing solid amounts of damage. Also, this build is provided with lots of active ki-dependant abilities to ensure that gameplay is very variable.

---
## Level Breakdown 🎲
This build focuses on [Monk](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/monk) leveling, so there is no multiclassing breakdown, only a single class.

---
## Race 👽
The race is [Wood elf](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/lineage:elf) in order to acquire longsword proficiency and increased movement speed. Because of proficiency, there will be ability to use longsword as dedicated weapon.

---
## Ability Scores 📊
To provide a high attack roll modifier and make use of subclass features, we will focus on maximizing our *Dexterity* and *Wisdom* modifiers. Additionally, we will make *Constitution* our third-highest score to gain more HP.

The table below shows the Ability Scores for our build (Race modifiers included).

| Ability | Score | Race Additions | Final | Modifier |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| Strength | 8 | None | **8** | -1 |
| Dexterity | 15 | +2 | **17** | +3 |
| Constitution | 15 | None | **15** | +2 |
| Intelligence | 8 | None | **8** | -1 |
| Wisdom | 15 | +1 | **16** | +3 |
| Charisma | 8 | None | **8** | -1 |

## Equipment 💣
Make sure to use a **Longsword**. This weapon gives us good damage and can be used as dedicated weapon.

That's a base of what you need, so you can even save some money after.

## Leveling Up ⬆️
This build becomes stronger over time by increasing modifiers, proficiency bonuses and gives more active abilities.

At **3rd level**, choose the [Way of Mercy subclass](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/monk:mercy). It is considered one of the best monk subclasses and provides user with ability to heal and deal damage.

The core of this build is **4th level**. At this level, grab the [Mobile feat](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:mobile) to be able to avoid enemy attacks.

At **5th level**, we gain an Extra Attack whcih is a greate addition to our build.

Lastly, as further you progress, the faster you are. For example on **6th level** you have movement speed:

**`35 (Wood elf) + 15 (class) + 10 (feat) = 60 ft.`**

This is a double movement speed of regular humanoids, so when you duel a creature there is almost no way it can catch and attacks you in the same turn. 

---

## Combat Mechanics & Synergy ⚡
On your turn at 5th level, use your regular action to attack with your longsword. Extra Attack lets you do this twice. Then, as a bonus action, you can attack with your unarmed strike.

Then you can run as far as possible without getting any opportunity attacks from enemies.

If every shot hits, the damage for one turn will be:

**`2d10 + 1d6 + 9 (DEX)`** *damage*.

And this amount may not sound very powerful but you can also use a few of the active abilities to deal more or heal someone.

---

## Conclusion ✅
With this build, you will be able to attack enemy and instantly fade away, breaking the number of visibl frames. 

I wish you an insane amount of speed and great character development!
